# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: passing a value of the wrong type to a function parameter. The provided code includes a function `calculateArea` that expects `Double` values for its width and height parameters. However, an incorrect call to this function attempts to pass a `String` value for the height, resulting in a compile-time error.

The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle type checking and prevent this issue.
